# Vagrant

Vagrant is a means of automating the setup of virtual machines. The instructions are saved in a vagrantfile. Through this method, it is possible to ensure everyone can run software in the same environment.

## Vagrantfiles

These can be updated, but to apply the changes to the virtual machine, it is necessary to use ```vagrant reload```, or to destroy and rebuild the virtual machine.

### Automating Provisioning

This is done in order to package all requirements associated with a project.

One way to provision is via a shell script on the virtual machine. This has to be set to be executable using ```chmod + [filename]```

```
#!/bin/bash

#update system and upgrade packages
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

#install nginx
sudo apt-get install nginx -y
```

Can also synchronise folders, using the commands shown in the vagrantfile contained in this directory.
Full vagrantfile is as below:

```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

 config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
# creating a virtual machine ubuntu 
# assign IP so that any webapps are accessible on host machine
 config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"
 #to get this working, require hostsupdater to be instlaled on localhost 
 config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]
 
 # Sync folder from OS to VM
 config.vm.synced_folder ".","/home/vagrant/app"

end
```

Finally, it is more efficient to simply run the shell script as part of the ```vagrant up``` procedure. This is done by adding the below line as a final step before ```end``` :

```
config.vm.provision :shell, path: "provision.sh"
```

This runs the ```provision.sh``` script, provided the path is given correctly. With all things working, we have now set upa virtual machine running a webserver, and can do so again with a single command.





# Appendix: Full List of Vagrant Options

These can also be brought up by simply typing ```vagrant``` in the command line after vagrant is installed:

```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

 config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
# creating a virtual machine ubuntu 
# assign IP so that any webapps are accessible on host machine
 config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"
 #to get this working, require hostsupdater to be instlaled on localhost 
 config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]
 
 # Sync folder from OS to VM
 config.vm.synced_folder ".","/home/vagrant/app"

end
```
